## 
    **                    - Purpose**


    	make an app that you can make fitness plans. This app will show different ways of doing exercises based on your goals(bodybuilding, lose weight, get lean) and it will cater to what you have around you. say if you only have dumbbells and kettlebells. your exercise plan will be made to suit only dumbbells and kettlebells. These exercises will also be put into muscle groups. say if you want back exercises, biceps, triceps, chest, legs, cardio etc, The app will make an exercise plan based on that. the user will be able to sign in so that they can have their own personal plans dedicated to them. depending on what they want to get out of doing exercises is what their exercise plan will be. 


## 
    **                    - Functionality / features**


    	The user will be able to include their height and size for personal notes. a timer for recording how long you have done the exercise for or how long you have to do it for. a reflection/note section for noting down reflections of the exercise and what to improve on. a kg selection on each of the exercises, this selection will allow users to be able to select the weight they have chosen. This selection will be useful for the user as it will show their weight lifting progression and what their previous bp is. most of these little features will be available when you click onto your activity/ exercise.

A lot of features I missed out on. Time management is a big problem for me.
